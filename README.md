#Create. API

This is our beta API, which gives you access to the majority of our customers resources within the application. We plan on releasing with most of the planned resources, but some will follow in a later release, this is outlined in the introduction.

## Developers

**This API is in private beta**

We've followed an RDD style of development, and have written the documentation before any code. If you've been invited to view this documentation, please have a read through and let us know if you see anything that we have missed anything fundimental or if something doesn't make sense.

Also, pull requests are welcome.

For the most recent documentation source, please view gh-pages branch.
